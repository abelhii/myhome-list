Build an Angular application to display a list of properties from the json file. The list items should show the following data:

- Main photo
- Address
- Price
- Beds
- Baths
- Agent logo

The list items should feature two different colour buttons - ‘view gallery’ and ‘view brochure’

Clicking on ‘view brochure’ should go to a new page which just displays the raw json object Clicking on ‘view gallery’ should open a page which displays the photos

The list items should be responsive.

The user should be able to sort and filter the list by price.

Create a git repository for your project and send a link
